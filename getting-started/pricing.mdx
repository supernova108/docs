    ### Step 3: Choose Your Plan

    You'll be presented with our pricing options. Here's how it works:

    *   **Base Subscription Fee:** A fixed monthly fee based on the number of orders you do per month.
    *   **Commission Rate:** A percentage charged *only* on the value of orders generated successfully through ReferRush referrals.
    *   **Tiered Structure:** We offer three commission rate tiers. Use the selection tool to choose the tier that works best for you. Selecting a different commission tier will adjust the fixed base subscription fee accordingly.

    <Info>
      **All Features Included:** Regardless of the tier you choose, you get access to *all* ReferRush features. Our pricing is designed to scale with your success.

    Select your preferred commission tier using the provided interface.
