## Configuring Your Referral Program Incentives

This is where you define *what* your advocates share and *what* they get in return for successful referrals. A compelling offer and reward structure is key to a successful program.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Step 1: Access Your ReferRush Dashboard

    Got to the ReferRush dashboard by clicking the "Open ReferRush Dashboard" button in the ReferRush app in your Shopify admin or go to `referrush.com/{your-store-name}/dashboard`.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 2: Navigate to Program Settings

    Within the ReferRush dashboard, locate and click on the "Program Settings" tab in the main navigation menu.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 3: Configure the  Offer

    In the Program Settings, the section there is a section dedicated to the " Offer". Here you will define the incentive given to the *new customer* being referred:

    *   **Discount Type:** Choose the kind of discount (e.g., Percentage Off, Fixed Amount Off).
    *   **Discount Value:** Enter the specific amount or percentage for the chosen discount type.
    *   **Minimum Order Value (Optional):** Set a minimum purchase amount required for the friend to redeem the offer.

    Configure these options based on your marketing strategy.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 4: Set Up the Reward

    Navigate to the section for the "Reward". This is the incentive given to the *existing customer* who made the successful referral:

    *   **Reward Type:** Select the type of reward (e.g., Discount Code for next purchase, Store Credit, Cash).
    *   **Calculation Method:** Choose how the reward value is determined:
        *   **Fixed Value:** A set amount or percentage regardless of the referred order value.
        *   **Variable (Order Value %):** A percentage based on the value of the order placed by the referred friend.
    *   **Reward Value:** Enter the specific amount or percentage for the reward.

    Choose the reward structure that best motivates your advocates.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 5: Set Reward Delivery Delay

    Find the setting for "Reward Delivery Days" or "Payout Delay". This determines how many days *after the referred friend's order is marked as delivered* the advocate will receive their reward.

    <Info>
      **Best Practice:** It's highly recommended to set this delay to be slightly longer than your store's return or exchange period (e.g., Return Period + 1 day). This prevents issuing rewards for orders that are later returned.
    </Info>

    Enter the number of days for the delay.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Step 6: Save Your Settings

    Once you have configured the Friend Offer, Advocate Reward, and Delivery Delay, make sure to save your changes by clicking the "Save" or "Update Settings" button.

  </Step>

</Steps>

With your offer and reward structure defined, the next step is to configure how customers will see and interact with your program via the [Pop-Up Setup](/setup/pop-up).
